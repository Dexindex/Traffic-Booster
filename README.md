# Traffic Booster

Traffic Booster is a Python tool designed to help increase the visibility and traffic of your website. By leveraging the Selenium WebDriver, this tool simulates website visits, optionally changing the MAC address of the network interface to simulate visits from different devices. This can be particularly useful for testing, marketing, and SEO purposes.

## Features

- Automated website visits using Selenium WebDriver.
- Optional MAC address spoofing for simulating visits from different devices.
- Customizable number of visits.
- Easy to use and configure.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run Traffic Booster, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- Google Chrome or Chromium Browser
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your Chrome version)

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3.x**

   Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Selenium**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
    pip install selenium


3. **Download ChromeDriver**

Download the ChromeDriver from [ChromeDriver - WebDriver for Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) that matches your Chrome version. Extract the executable and place it in a known directory.

4. **Set ChromeDriver Path**

Ensure that the path to ChromeDriver is added to your system's PATH environment variable.

5. **Clone or Download This Repository**

Download the Traffic Booster script to your local machine.

## Configuration

Before running the script, you may need to adjust a few settings:

- **URL**: Replace `https://your-website.ma/` with the URL of the website you wish to boost traffic to.
- **Interface Name**: If using MAC address spoofing, replace `"Ethernet"` with the name of your network interface.
- **Number of Visits**: Adjust `num_visits` to control how many times the script visits the website.

## Usage

To run Traffic Booster, navigate to the directory containing the script and run:
python traffic_booster.py


## Important Notes

- This tool is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Use it responsibly and ethically.
- Changing your MAC address may have implications on your network connectivity and is not supported on all platforms. Proceed with caution.
- Ensure you have permission to increase traffic on the website in question to avoid any potential legal issues.
